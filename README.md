# AI-Rep Protocol  
## The AI Representative Protocol for an Open Conversational Web

[Español](https://github.com/FedeRacun/AI-Rep/blob/master/README.es.md)

The way people access information is changing.  
Increasingly, we don’t just search on Google... **we ask an AI**.

However, the answers we get are not always from the most reliable sources.  
They often rely on inference, summaries, or outdated data.  
That needs to change.

## 💡 What if every site had its own official AI representative?

An AI that speaks for itself.  
Accurately representing its information, business, or community.  
Capable of interacting with ChatGPT, Perplexity, or any other AI assistant, providing precise, authorized, and real-time responses.

This is the core idea behind **AI-Rep**.

## 🎯 What is AI-Rep?

AI-Rep is an open protocol that any website or online service can implement to:

- Automatically answer questions about its own content.  
- Be directly queried by AI assistants.  
- Provide clear, reliable, and verifiable responses.

---

## 🧩 How does AI-Rep work?

- A standard discovery file located at `/.well-known/ai-rep.json` declares the AI representative service.  
- A public API endpoint, e.g., `/ai-rep/assistant`, receives questions and returns structured answers.  
- AI assistants like ChatGPT or Perplexity can query these official sources directly.

## 🌐 Why does AI-Rep matter?

- **Narrative control:** Each organization decides what its AI representative says.  
- **Accuracy:** Less hallucination. More truth.  
- **New SEO layer:** Optimization for conversational AI engines, not just search engines.  
- **Open Internet:** Anyone can publish their AI representative. Anyone can ask.
